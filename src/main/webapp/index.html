				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I thrive on learning through doing – this website itself is a testament to that philosophy.
					It's hosted on my homelab Kubernetes cluster where I maintain a full cloud-native DevOps tooling
					suite to accelerate my capabilities including:

				</ul>
				<p>
				While my day job as a Software Engineering Specialist involves building enterprise Java
				applications, my passion for understanding systems deeply has led me to go beyond typical enterprise development.
				I redesigned a developer bootcamp for a fully-remote workforce and have onboarded over 100 developers through that experience, and built my
				company's first DocuSign API integration – automating paper application collection and creating the status service that delivered over a
				billion dollars in savings for a critical public-service mission.
				</p>
				<p>
				This hands-on approach has given me unique insights into both the technical and human sides of software development.
				My goal is to leverage this experience to create technology that serves people well and makes a positive impact.
				Whether I'm mentoring new developers, optimizing infrastructure, or volunteering my IT expertise to non-profits,
				I'm driven by the belief that technology should be both powerful and purposeful.
				</p>
				<p>
				The name '<span class="tech-term">ethosengine</span>' embodies my core mission. In our digital
				world, we are saturated with emotional appeals (<span class="tech-term">pathos</span>) and technical
				justifications (<span class="tech-term">logos</span>), yet what we urgently need is <span
					class="tech-term">ethos</span> – ethical credibility. Building trust is the hardest thing to do
				and the easiest to break, especially in an age of information overload. My aim is to build trust
				into the tools we create, technology that not only functions effectively but also empowers us to
				live wisely.
